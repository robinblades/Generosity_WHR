                The pandemic has pushed millions into <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R46270.pdf">poverty.</a>
                But has the economic strain made people less generous? Depends on the country. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every year, the Gallup World Poll measures generosity around the world. 
                Each countryâ€™s generosity is calculated not based on how <i>much</i> citizens give, but how <i>many</i> citizens give.
                Giving can take the form of charitable donations, volunteer time, or helping strangers.

                <p>The X axis is log GDP per capita: a measure of each country's wealth.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <p>The Y axis is generosity relative to each country's average income. </p>

                <p>This is how generosity changed during the pandemic.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <p>In most countries, generosity has gone down relative to average income during the pandemic and stayed low.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <p>Especially countries that started off low in generosity compared to average income, like Greece, Botswana, and Japan. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <p>But a few countries were high in generosity relative to average income and stayed high throughout the pandemic. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <p>Like Indonesia, Myanmar, and Haiti. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <p> A few countries even went up in generosity relative to average income, like Gambia. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <p> While others, like the United States, went down a lot. </p>
