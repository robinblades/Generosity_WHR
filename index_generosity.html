                The pandemic has pushed millions into <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R46270.pdf">poverty.</a>
                But has the economic strain made people less generous? Depends on the country. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every year, the Gallup World Poll measures generosity around the world. 
                Each countryâ€™s generosity is calculated not based on how <i>much</i> citizens give, but how <i>many</i> citizens give.
                Giving can take the form of charitable donations, volunteer time, or helping strangers.

                <p>Overall, generosity seems to have gone down relative to average income during the pandemic.</p>
