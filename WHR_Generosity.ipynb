    "# Generosity During the Pandemic Analysis\n",

    "### How has the world's generosity changed over the course of the pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent analysis of World Happiness Report data from 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: generosity scores are relative to average income in each country, meaning this analysis is looking at if countries are more/less generous than expected based on income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. World average generosity dropped dramatically from 2019 to 2020 and stayed low in 2021.\n",
    "2. Countries high in generosity in 2019 stayed high in generosity.\n",
    "3. Countries low in generosity in 2019 decreased drastically in generosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Generosity scores were not correlated with size of country, gdp or size of economic downturn during 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings resulted in this [D3 story](https://robinblades.github.io/Generosity_WHR/index_generosity.html)."

    "- Australia\n",
    "- New Zealand\n",

    "\n",
    "Data details: \n",
    "\n",
    "1,000 individuals from each country were surveyed by the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx), typically 3/4 face-to-face and 1/4 over the phone. During the pandemic, all were surveyed online. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generosity index is based on their answer to the following question: \n",
    "Have you done any of the following in the past month? \n",
    "- donated money to a charity?\n",
    "- volunteered your time to an organization?\n",
    "- helped a stranger or someone you didn't know who needed help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are also weighted to ensure that the data is representative of population level statistics for each country (based on gender, age, income, education, urban/rural, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: One caveot to this data is that communities may express their generosity in  ways not captured by the WHR measures. For example, some Nordic countries may have strong social safety nets, and citizens help others by paying taxes. This institutionalized generosity may reduce the prevalence of individual acts of generosity (such as volunteering or donation), and therefore not be captured by the WHR reports."
